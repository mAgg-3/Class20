C20 Topic Designing Algorithms

Install Visual Code Studio. 

● Download Boilerplate code. 

● Design algorithm for collision detection, write code and test the program.



An algorithm is a method to solve a problem. A computer algorithm is a set of instructions given to the computer to get a job done or solve a problem.

In this class, we will work on designing our own algorithm for two classic tasks in games: 

1. Detecting collision between two objects. 
2. 2. Bouncing off the objects on collision.
